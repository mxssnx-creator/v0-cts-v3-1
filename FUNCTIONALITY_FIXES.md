# CTS v3 - Functionality Fixes Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Toast Notification System
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Toast messages were transparent
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `components/ui/sonner.tsx` with `!opacity-100` classes
  - Verified `lib/simple-toast.tsx` wrapper is correctly implemented
  - All toast imports are working correctly

### 2. API Response Functions
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Inconsistent API response formats
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `app/api/settings/system/route.ts` to use correct `api-toast` functions
  - Added proper error handling with descriptive messages
  - Implemented UPSERT logic to prevent data loss

### 3. Exchange Connections
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Missing exchanges in database, connection creation failing
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `scripts/002_create_exchanges_table.sql` to include all exchanges (bybit, bingx, pionex, orangex, okx)
  - Modified `app/api/settings/connections/route.ts` to auto-create missing exchanges
  - Added validation for required fields
  - Added ON CONFLICT clauses to prevent duplicate errors

### 4. Settings Save Functionality
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Settings were being overwritten instead of updated
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented UPSERT logic with `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
  - Added detailed logging for debugging
  - Settings now only update on explicit request, never lost

### 5. Database Connection
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED
- **Solution**: Using native PostgreSQL with proper connection pooling via `pg` package, or SQLite for local development
